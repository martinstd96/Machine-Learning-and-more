I order the general tso and noodles and it was amazing plus it came with an egg roll! I was raised in NY and Panda House is by far my favorite NY-style Chinese fast food (you can dine-in too) restaurant in Nashville. I have never been disappointed in the quality of the food, the portions, or the service. They are one of the very few Chinese restaurants in the area who know how to make fried wontons so that they are both crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The food is never too greasy or heavy with oil or sauce. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was how CLEAN this place looked and smelled! The staff was super fast and friendly ... and the food was fresh, hot and delicious!!!!!! What a pleasant surprise! Take out....\\nOrdered Hot And Sour soup.. received WonTon soup! Big difference between the two!\\n\\nPaid for Dinner size meal.. rec\\'d lunch size!!\\nWas very bland...\\n\\nHave to admit.. crab rangoon are good!\\nNot worth the $22 Horrible. I had to throw away all my food. Not even joking. I was expecting much better when I read the reviews but my general tsos chicken tasted like it had cleaning chemicals in it and the crab Rangoon was spoiled. Tasted like acidic vomit. I will never go back. Please, if you want Chinese, go somewhere else. Waste of 20 bucks. Finally found a Chinese food place less than 20 minutes from me. I was super excited and ordered most of my favorites: chicken lo mein, pork egg foo young, chicken and broccoli, and egg rolls. \\n\\n\\nOther than that I picked up my food, took it home and it was all still warm by the time I got home. The place was clean and the staff was nice when I arrived to pick up my order. \\n\\nThe pricing was good for the amount of food you got. \\n\\nMost all of the food was good! Chicken Lo mein is my favorite and it looked amazing but sadly was very bland which is the only reason I give it 4/5. \\n\\nOther than that I can defiantly see myself going here again. I love this place it\\'s good basic Chinese food! Staff is nice! Only thing that is weird, is the rice color (yellow). But it\\'s good. Food is ALWAYS hot and ready! Always ready within 10-15 min! The boneless ribs are LIFE. I\\'ve been going here for years and it\\'s always consistent with its services. Half way through eating my food I figured I would write a review bc it was so good. I always order the vegetable lo mein (spicy). I\\'ve tried soooo many other lo meins out there but this is the one lol I asked for the restroom and they said it\\'s out of order. They had it blocked off with tables. I knew it couldn\\'t be out of order because the staff would have no restroom if it was. So while they were preparing my order,I moved the tables and found that the restroom as NOT out of order.  English translation: \"We do not want our customers using our restrooms.\"  My message them: \"We do not want Nashvillians to eat at your restaurant.\"\\n\\nTheir food is your average strip mall Chinese, with the same menu, even. We moved from Miami to Nashville three years ago and had been on the hunt for some cheap, tasty, basic, no fuss chinese takeout and this is the place. It took us years to find this gem. This time we had Boneless Ribs, Honey Chicken, and House fried Rice. The staff is really nice and the food is hot and ready when it says it should be. The crispy noodles are an extra couple of cents on the menu which is lame and I\\'d recommend getting a drink elsewhere but aside from that everything is tip top. I love this place! I\\'m a repeating customer because I love their crab rangoons, dumplings, seasame chcicken, and sweet and sour chicken. The shrimp plates are amazing too. It\\'s literally the best. I would suggest getting chicken plates instead of beef/pork because I had beef and broccoli once and it wasn\\'t as good as all the other chicken plates. You have to give them a try! I wish I could give them more stars because it\\'s my fav Chinese spot! This is one of the best Chinese places I\\'ve been to. It\\'s great americanized Chinese food. I\\'ve been here a few times and every time my food was fresh and hot! I ordered through DoorDash and the driver delivered it 20 minutes late but the food was so hot and fresh! They have a great variety of foods and this place is definitely worth coming to and back! The best lo mein I have ever had. The hot sauce is amazing. I wished I had ordered more! I will definitely be eating here way more often Food was great and hot still when I got home.  Best I have had in Nashville area so far. This is slightly above average Chinese food for Nashville. It\\'s good for take-out because the temperature is extremely hot. I\\'ve only had the lunch menu: Kung Pao chicken, Spicy Chicken, Teriyaki chicken on a stick. All decent. They seem to be popular. I have never had a bad meal here, and the employees are always kind. I would recommend to anyone and everyone. My current favorite is Beef and broccoli spicy.

We ordered take out, they are only offering take out and delivery currently.  The wait time I was given (and everyone that called while I wasn't waiting ) was 25 min. 45 min later my food was ready.  I live about 5 min away and when I got home all of the food had to reheated. However the food was very good. It wasn't the typical oil drenched American Chinese take out. It wasn't as delicious as food I have had in Chinatown but as far as local spots, this is back to being my go to place. Everything we ordered was really great. Best Chinese food we've found in the area so far. They are open again! \\nWe have tried many Chinese restaurants in the area since they closed, but nothing ever came close to Kowloon.  We have ordered twice since they  re-opened, and have enjoyed it both times. They just opened for about a week when I did my Lunar New Year  dinner takeout so they had some hiccups.  I'm sure they will sort it out in a few weeks and improve their service.  In terms of food, they are better than most American Chinese food places around here.  It's not too greasy. I like the garlic soy dipping sauce that comes with the fried dumplings  and scallion pancake. Portions are fine.  Overall, their food are better than expected (as a Chinese person reviewing them).  Place looks clean! I never got to try this place before the fire and they closed for a few years. I'm glad that they reopened and I got to order. I got beef chow fun, chicken lo mein, hot and sour soup and wonton soup. The wontons are typical wontons that you would get at most places but the broth is so good! Very flavorful. I love their hot and sour soup. The beef chow fun was a little skimpy on the beef but overall good. My toddler daughter loves the lo mein. Can't wait to try other dishes I didn't get to check Kowloon out before the fire, so i was excited to order once they reopened & was not disappointed! Kowloon has become my go-to for Chinese in the Lansdale area. The food has been consistently delicious, fresh, and less greasy than other places. Their noodle & fried rice entrees and combos come with lots of veggies & good amounts of meat/tofu. Their chicken with garlic sauce & hunan style chicken are especially enjoyable! The woman at the front is always friend & the food is always on time & packaged well for takeout. Fantastic food, friendly service. We are willing to go out of our way for this place for sure After trying many Chinese places in the area, we finally found one that's clearly a step above all others.  I also love Mei Ting for the same reasons, but now live too far away to frequent them any longer.... That said, Kowloon is now our GO-TO Chinese place.  \\nMuch higher quality dishes than you usually get around here.  Chicken dishes like the Sesame Chicken are all white meat and not over-breaded like so many other places.  The King Pao is out of this world - flavor, portion size, etc - all on point.  Fried rice was perfect, for lack of a better word, and the crab rangoons are simply phenomenal.  \\nThis is, and will always be, our Chinese take-out place of choice.  \\nYou'll never be disappointed with Kowloon! Definitely worth the money, and it has tons of delicious options. One of the only places you can get pork buns in the area too! So excited that Kowloon is open again!!  Food is always amazing!!   They are perfectly set up for takeout or delivery during this difficult time. Happy we discovered Kowloon this weekend! Saw a bunch of good reviews online, so decided to try it. Really enjoyed our food and it wasn't greasy like Chinese food sometimes is. My favorite was the Singapore noodles. So tasty! Can't wait to go back! I was in the area so I called in an order to pick up on my way home. I ordered eggplant with garlic sauce and some lo mein. The order was just ready when I got there and the person that I picked up from was courteous and friendly. The food was well prepared and the ingredients were very fresh. Nice find via Yelp. They are back!  Our favorite Chinese restaurant has returned from a 3-year hiatus and their food is as good as it was back then.  Great wonton, dumplings, roast pork, and lo mein. Our family has ordered four times since they have been open in the last two weeks and they have not disappointed us. Delicious. Always fast and efficient. Online ordering is always easy and accurate. They text you when it's ready. \\n\\nTry their general Tso chicken it's the best!
